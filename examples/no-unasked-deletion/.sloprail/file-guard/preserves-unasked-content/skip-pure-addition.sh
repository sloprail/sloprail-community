# prepare (the file-guard's copy, over the committed Changeset): decide whether the

# words — needs no preparing: the template reads `change` and `changeset.citations`
# straight off its input.

# SKIPS THE JUDGE on a PURE ADDITION — REQUIRED, not cosmetic. When
# removes-content.sh waives the citation for an append, this judge would still
# run and judge a diff with nothing removed against no citation (correctly none:
# nothing needed authorizing), and refuse a healthy append. Measured against a
# real Haiku run (eval/add-section). `{"skip": true}` abstains instead, and no
# model call is spent on a change that removes nothing.
