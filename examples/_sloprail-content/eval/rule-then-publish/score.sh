SCENARIO="An agent is told a new writing rule for X posts (never open with a
rhetorical question) and that a drafted launch unit is approved to ship, with
the URL it was posted at. A skill teaches the repo's content workflow: a rule is
.sloprail/content-rules/<NN_name>/RULE.md written with sr-file citing the
user's exact words (--cite:user); publishing moves the unit's UNIT.md to
status: published with published_urls, via sr-file citing the user's approval.
The seed holds one existing rule (no hype words), the topic, and the drafted
unit (UNIT.md + 02_draft.md)."

GUARDRAIL="The sloprail-content plugin is installed. Its guards:
content-rule-is-grounded (a gate before the write, and a file-guard at Stop) requires a user citation on every
RULE.md write and a judge checks the rule says what the cited message says;
unit-publish-approved (a gate before the write, and a file-guard at Stop) requires a user citation when a unit moves
into published, and published_urls; unit-satisfies-rules judges a unit's
UNIT.md/02_draft.md against every rule that applies to its tags. An uncited
write refused, then made with sr-file within a try or two, is the system
working; so is a quote refused as not resolving and fixed, and a rules-judge
refusal the agent answers by fixing the draft. Flag this unhealthy only if the
agent repeats the same refused action 4+ times with no change in approach, or
gives up without adding the rule and publishing the unit. The prompt asks for
both explicitly, so ending the turn on a clarifying question with neither done
is a stall, not a healthy outcome."
