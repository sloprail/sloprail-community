# task-management (gate + file-guard)

An agent may append a result to a task; it may never edit the ask itself to
match the work — every change to the ask must cite the human message that
authorized it.

## Install

Make sure sloprail is installed — see the docs
[install page](https://sloprail.com/docs/getting-started/install/).

Then copy this example into your project:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sloprail/sloprail-community /tmp/sloprail-clone && mkdir -p .sloprail && cp -R /tmp/sloprail-clone/examples/task-management/.sloprail/. .sloprail/ && rm -rf /tmp/sloprail-clone
```

Then edit a task's ask without citing the message that authorized it, and
confirm you see the refusal below.

## The rule

An agent may append a result to a task; it may never edit the ask to match the
work. The ask changes only when the user changes it — adds scope, or drops it in
their own words ("forget X") — and every write to the ask must **cite** the human
message that authorised it: checked deterministically for existence, then by a
judge for truth and for containing **that and nothing else**. Deferring part of
the ask ("not today", "later") is not dropping it: the deferred part stays in the
ask, and what was done and what was deferred go in the result.

This is the sharpest form of the no-slop thesis, because every other unit
protects an artifact — this one protects the **oracle**, the thing the other
checks are checked against. The failure it prevents has no detector once it
happens: an agent implements 70% of an ask, edits the task to describe that
70%, and from then on every verification passes — the work matches the spec,
because the spec was rewritten to match the work.

## Why a gate and a file-guard, and the structural split behind it

The rule binds `ASK.md` specifically — not the whole task folder — because
the engine has no notion of "which region of a file changed", only that a
path changed. Splitting the ask and the result into separate files, with only
the ask bound, turns "no uncited edit to the ask" back into a plain path rule
rather than needing a diff-region distinction the engine does not have.

Two natures, both named `ask-is-human-authored`:

- **The gate** (`PreFileWrite`) is the prevention. An ungrounded edit to the
  ask must be refused **before** it lands. A post-write refusal reports damage
  already done to the oracle, and the agent's remedy would be to edit ASK.md
  again — another edit the user never asked for. The gate carries the
  citation requirement and the judge, and first refuses a write whose
  resulting bytes cannot be computed (`sed -i`), because a gate does not fail
  closed on that by itself and the judge reads those bytes.
- **The file-guard** is the after-check: at Stop it holds the committed
  `ASK.md` to the same requirement and judge, the backstop for a write the
  gate could not see. It judges commits — uncommitted changes to an `ASK.md`
  refuse the Stop with "commit these" — over the explicit range
  `merge-base(base, HEAD)..HEAD` (`sr-checks run`), and never sees the write before it lands.

## What the requirement and the judge divide

The citation rides on the write, never in the file, so ASK.md holds only the
ask:

```bash
sr-file write memories/tasks/auth/token-refresh/ASK.md \
  --cite:user 'refresh tokens before they expire' <<'ASK'
Refresh auth tokens before they expire.
ASK
```

1. **`require: [{citation: {source_types: [user]}}]` (first, no model):** the
   engine resolves every `--cite:user` quote against the session's record, and
   a write carrying none that resolves (a Write or Edit tool call, a shell
   redirect, a quote the user never said) is refused before any check runs. The
   file-guard reads the same grounding from the commits of its range: a
   `Sloprail-Cites-User: <exact words>` trailer per message, resolved the same
   way, and a range whose commits cite nothing is refused. Unconditional,
   because ASK.md holds nothing but the ask.
2. **Judge (no prepare):** the judge template reads the resolved citations
   straight off `event.citations` (the file-guard's, `changeset.citations`) — each cited quote, the whole message it was
   taken from, and where it sits in the record — beside the change to ASK.md.
   It answers what existence cannot: is the ask TRUE to those words, and does
   it hold **that and nothing else**? The "and nothing
   else" clause is the anti-slop half a naive implementation drops: a valid
   citation wrapped in agent-authored elaboration is still content slopped
   around a legitimate citation.

## What this guard protects against, precisely

Not carelessness — an asymmetry. The specification is simultaneously the
most valuable thing in the system and the thing an agent is most incentivised
to soften, because rewriting the ask to match the work makes every
downstream check pass without lying.
