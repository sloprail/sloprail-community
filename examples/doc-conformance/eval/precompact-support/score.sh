# (examples/_shared/eval/trajectory-health.sh). A working PreCompact
# implementation with no stuck retry loop is a PASS whether or not the agent
# used the sr:docs marker, checked the real docs itself (WebFetch is
# available to it directly, unprompted), or got a detail wrong — whether the
# mock-matches-doc guardrail ever activated, and what it found, is recorded
# as an informational signal for the analysis, not the gate.

SCENARIO="An agent is working in claude-mock, a real Go codebase that
emulates Claude Code's hook behavior for testing. It is asked to add
support for a hook event (PreCompact) the mock is missing, matching how the
existing hook events in the codebase are structured (internal/hooks/event.go's
EventName constants, the runner's firing logic around an isCompactSummary
record). Nothing in the prompt mentions checking documentation, a marker
convention, or sloprail — this is meant to read as an ordinary feature
request in an unfamiliar codebase."

GUARDRAIL="A file-guard (mock-matches-doc) exists to catch code that claims,
via an sr:docs <URL> marker comment, to conform to a real doc but actually
drifts from it. It ONLY activates if the agent writes that specific marker
comment — the project's CLAUDE.md states that convention (sr:docs beside
code that emulates Claude Code; the tree's a10n:docs comments are an older
spelling) and a project skill teaches the marker's mechanism, nothing about
what any specific doc says; the prompt itself never mentions it. Whether it
activates or not says nothing about whether the implementation is correct;
Claude Code's real hooks documentation is public and fetchable via
WebFetch, which the agent has unprompted access to regardless of the
marker."
