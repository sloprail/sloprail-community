# A named writer is the writer. With none, the calls that could have written

# trajectory owes it. With none of those either, nothing the agent ran wrote
# it (a user's edit, git bringing in committed content with no hook).
# A call that could write UNSEEN is charged only if the file changed at or
# after the time that call could have run: its status-change time (ctime),
# which no one can set back (`touch -d` and os.utime move mtime, and change
# ctime to now). A file that last changed before this cycle began — a user's
# edit between turns — was not written by this cycle's calls. A background
# job is measured from its own start in the earlier cycle, so a user edit made
# while such a job still runs IS charged: the two cannot be told apart.
# An unknown time on either side fails closed (charged).
# A file's ctime in epoch seconds: the GNU/BusyBox form first, then BSD's
# (macOS rejects -c). Not chosen by `stat --version` — BusyBox rejects it,
# and there BSD's -f means filesystem status (%c = total inodes). Anything but
