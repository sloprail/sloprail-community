# Shared by the pinned-spec-holds gate and its file-guard: one library, two thin entries.
# `when` for the user citation a pinned rule needs. The gate entry reads the pending
# write (Pre* events, the working tree, HEAD); the file-guard entry reads the Changeset
# (each file at the range's base and at head, in the committed tree). Everything that
# decides what a pin is, and whether a change touches one, is here and reads no event:
#
#   lib_setup                       the environment, waive(), jq
#   lib_tree WORKSPACE BASE [FLAGS] where the project is (git grep FLAGS reads the
#                                   working tree: --untracked for the gate) and the
#                                   revision "before" means (HEAD; the range's base)
#   lib_evaluate ...                one file (see it)
#   lib_finish                      every file changed nothing pinned: waive
#
# Exit 0 (via apply) — this change touches a spec some sr:invariant marker pins, or moves
# what a marker pins, so it must cite the user's words asking for that change. Exit 1
# (via lib_finish) — it does not. Three ways a change does:
#
#   1. It changes a spec line a marker pins (or deletes the spec, or puts a new
#      file where the base had one) — the rule itself changes.
#   2. It changes any other line of a spec some marker pins: a new rule, a
#      rewording, an exception on a line of its own. A pinned spec holds the
#      user's business rules, like an ask: an uncited "3. Goodwill refunds may
#      exceed the charge" beside a pinned "2. A refund must never exceed the
#      charge" is how a real run left the spec contradicting itself (231517Z).
#   3. It moves or removes a marker so the code stops being pinned to the wording
#      it was pinned to: the marker dropped, or re-pinned to different text. A
#      re-pin to the SAME text (the rule moved down a line) changes nothing, and
#      neither does a marker that leaves this file while another file carries it
#      (marked code moved: written with its marker in the new place first).
#
# THIS IS A `when` PREDICATE, NOT A CHECK: exit 0 does not permit anything — it
# APPLIES the requirement. So every path this code cannot decide exits 0, the
# fail-closed direction. Only waive() exits 1, on a decided "changes nothing
# pinned", and prints a sentinel only-when-pinned.sh looks for; any other exit 1
# (a crash, a tool that failed) is turned into 0 by the trap in lib_setup.
#
# Bytes, not meaning: a pinned line changed only in whitespace or line endings is
# changed, as it is to pin-still-matches-head.sh, which compares the same bytes.
# Markers inside a git submodule are not seen (git grep does not enter one).
