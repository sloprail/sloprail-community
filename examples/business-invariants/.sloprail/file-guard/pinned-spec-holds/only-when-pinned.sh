# prepare: ask the judge only about a changeset that changes what a marker pins — the
# same decision changes-pinned-lines.sh makes for the citation requirement, drawn
# at the same line the engine's `when` draws it: only a decided waiver skips the
# judge — exit 1 WITH the predicate's `{"waived": …}` sentinel. Any other outcome
# (exit 0, a crash, a script that could not run, an exit 1 that printed no
# sentinel) leaves the citation demanded, and so goes to the judge; skipping it
# there would let any resolvable quote admit the change.
#
# The predicate's `what` says what the change does to which pin; the judge gets it.
# It reads the same Changeset payload changes-pinned-lines.sh does: stdin is inherited.
