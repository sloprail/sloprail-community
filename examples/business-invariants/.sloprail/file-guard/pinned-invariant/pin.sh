# Sourced by pin-still-matches-head.sh and pinned-text.sh, so both read a pin the
# same way. An sr:invariant marker's fqn is a pinned spec reference:
#   <repo>@<sha>:<path>#L<start>-<end>
# The fqn is written by the agent being judged, so nothing in it reaches git
# unchecked:
#
#   - The sha must be a FULL commit id (40 hex digits, or 64 in a SHA-256
#     repository), and it is read as an object id only. A short sha resolves
#     through refs first, so a branch or tag named like it would stand in for it;
#     and an option in its place (`--output=<file>`) would have git write a file.
#   - <repo> must be this project's own repository: a pin into another checkout
#     names text nothing here guards.
#   - The path must be a spec: `SPEC.md` at any depth, or a `.md` file under a
#     `specs/` directory, case-insensitively (macOS file systems are). That is
#     what pinned-spec-holds matches, so a pin anywhere else would name a rule
#     nothing guards. Change the two together (a test holds them in step).
#   - The range must be a real one inside the file: a range past its end pins no
#     text, and a judge handed an empty <pinned> rules against nothing.
