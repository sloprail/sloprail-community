# Sourced by the goodwill-refund scorers. Two deterministic marks of a refusal
# loop, read from the transcript's structure — each one fails the run whatever the
# trajectory-health judge concluded, because a judge reading a long record called
# a run with seven Stop bounces "textbook healthy" (goodwill-refund-commits,
# 2026-09-27):
#
#   - 4 or more Stop hooks refused the turn (hook_blocking_error on Stop): the
#     agent kept ending a turn the rules would not let end.
#   - the same sr-file command was refused twice or more: a refused cited change
#     re-submitted unchanged, as though the refusal might not repeat.
#
# loop_gates <transcript>: sets LG_STATUS (pass|fail), LG_STOPS, LG_REPEATS and
# LG_REASON.
