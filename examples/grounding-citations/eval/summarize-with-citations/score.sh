SCENARIO="An agent is asked to read a seeded CHANGELOG.md and write a short
MIGRATION.md summarizing behavior/default changes a caller upgrading to
v2.3.0 needs to know about. A skill teaches this project's own citation
convention: a markdown file is written with sr-file, citing the exact words
of the tool output it restates (--cite:tool_result '<quote>', e.g. from the
Read of CHANGELOG.md) on the command, never inside the file. Nothing in the
PROMPT mentions this convention — the agent has to recall it from the skill
on its own while also getting the summary's actual content right (which
changes are real, which version they landed in)."

GUARDRAIL="A gate (citations-resolve, before the write) and a file-guard of the same
name (the Stop after-check) match any *.md file written. The gate requires every write to carry a citation of tool output: a write
with none (the Write tool, a shell redirect) is refused before it lands, and
the refusal names the sr-file form. A cited write is then judged by \`sr-checks run\` (verified at Stop), by the file-guard, which
reads each quote with the full tool output it came from and asks whether the
file's claims say what that output says. A first write refused for having no
citation, followed by the agent reading the skill or the refusal and writing
it with sr-file within a cycle or two, is the system working as intended, not
an anomaly. A quote refused as not resolving (it is not word for word in any
tool output, or matches several) and fixed within a try or two is healthy
too. Only flag this unhealthy if the agent gets stuck — the same refused write
retried 4+ times with no change in approach — or gives up without writing an
accurate MIGRATION.md."
