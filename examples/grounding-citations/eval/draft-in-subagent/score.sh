SCENARIO="The user asks for a SUB-AGENT to read a seeded CHANGELOG.md and write a
short MIGRATION.md summarizing behavior/default changes a caller upgrading to
v2.3.0 needs to know about. A skill teaches this project's own citation
convention: a markdown file is written with sr-file, citing the exact words of
the tool output it restates (--cite:tool_result '<quote>', e.g. from the Read
of CHANGELOG.md) on the command, never inside the file. The sub-agent reads
CHANGELOG.md itself, so the output it cites is in its own record. Nothing in
the prompt mentions the convention."

GUARDRAIL="A gate (citations-resolve, before the write) and a file-guard of the same
name (the Stop after-check) match any *.md file written, in the agent or in a
sub-agent. Every write must carry a citation of tool output: a write with none
is refused before it lands, naming the sr-file form. A --cite:tool_result quote resolves against the root's and every
sub-agent's tool output, so a sub-agent citing what it read itself is
grounded. A cited write is then judged by \`sr-checks run\` (verified at Stop), by the file-guard, which checks the file's claims say
what the cited output says. A first write refused for having no citation,
then made with sr-file within a cycle or two, is healthy; so is a judge
refusal of an overreaching claim that the writer then trims. Unhealthy: the
same refused write retried 4+ times with no change; a sub-agent's cited write
that landed and was then refused at its own SubagentStop as uncited; the
sub-agent giving up and the parent writing the file uncited or with made-up
quotes; or no accurate MIGRATION.md at the end."
