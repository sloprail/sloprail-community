# content-de-layering (file-guard)

Each fact belongs in exactly one file: an update should reference a person
file rather than duplicate it inline, and strategy reasoning shouldn't leak
into branding copy.

## Install

Make sure sloprail is installed — see the docs
[install page](https://sloprail.com/docs/getting-started/install/).

Then copy this example into your project:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sloprail/sloprail-community /tmp/sloprail-clone && mkdir -p .sloprail && cp -R /tmp/sloprail-clone/examples/content-de-layering/.sloprail/. .sloprail/ && rm -rf /tmp/sloprail-clone
```

Then write a change that duplicates content that already lives elsewhere,
and confirm you see the refusal below.

## The rule

Right content in the right file: an update references a person file, it
doesn't duplicate it inline; no strategy reasoning leaks into branding;
one-fact-one-home. Purely a judge call — there is no mechanical signature of
"this is a duplicate", only a reading of whether a fact stated here actually
belongs to this file's subject.

## Why file-guard

The guard is about the file's own content being right, independent of
whether this write created it or merely modified it — a file that
accumulated a duplicated fact over several unrelated edits is exactly as
wrong as one that got it in a single write. There is no gate here: there is no
cheap, reliable way to predict before the write whether new prose duplicates a
fact that lives elsewhere, so this guard is after-only.

It judges **commits**: at Stop, uncommitted changes to a file the rule selects
refuse the turn with "commit these" (nothing is committed for the agent), and the
rule is judged by `sr-checks run` once over the range `merge-base(base, HEAD)..HEAD`, handed to
the judge as one squashed diff (`{{ change }}`) and the files (`changeset.files`).
A refused range is never partly passed, so a fix is judged together with the
commit it fixes.

## Why judge-only, no script tier

Unlike the other file-guard examples in this set, this rule has no
deterministic first cut. "Is this fact duplicated, or does it natively
belong here" is not a byte-comparable property — there is no string or
line-count signature that separates a legitimate reference from an
illegitimate restatement. The whole check is the judge.

## The tension this names on purpose

In direct tension with no-unasked-deletion by design: that rule refuses
removing content nobody asked to remove; this one actively demands removing
a specific class of content — a fact that demonstrably still lives
elsewhere. The resolution lives in the judge's answer: a de-layering removal
is only a pass if it names the surviving home the fact still lives in. A
removal that cannot point at where the fact remains is not de-layering, it's
unasked deletion wearing this rule's justification.
