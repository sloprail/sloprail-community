# subjects: one per module that has candidates left to judge (leaks-lib.sh: its own search, scoped
# to the lines this range adds, minus its home, tests and exceptions: what find-leaks.sh hands the
# judge). A module with none has nothing to judge and no subject.
#   files        the changed files the leftover candidates sit in, and the module's own module.yaml
#                and candidates.sh when they changed
#   fingerprint  what the judge reads beyond them: the leftover candidates themselves (a candidate
#                in a file the range did not touch, when module.yaml or candidates.sh changed), the
#                module's boundary and concern (module.yaml), its candidates.sh and the ADRs'
#                exceptions.
# Adding code that matches module A's search leaves module B's subject as it was.
# A lookup that fails refuses (leaks-lib.sh): a failed one is never "no candidates", which would
# judge nothing. What grows (the candidates, the changed paths, the exceptions) goes to jq by file,
# never as one command-line argument (Linux caps one at 128 KB).
