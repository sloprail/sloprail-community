# Steps 1 and 2 of module-leaks, shared by prepare (find-leaks.sh) and by the `subjects:` script,
# so both see the same candidates. Every lookup here refuses when it fails (the callers run these
# at top level or in `||` context, where `refuse` ends the script): a failed lookup is never an
# empty list of candidates, which would let every leak through. Source after changeset.sh, modules.sh and adr.sh, with
# load_modules and load_adrs already called. Written for speed (it runs in `verify`): the
# filtering of a module's candidates is one awk, not a process per candidate.

# leak_setup — what steps 1-2 compare with: CHANGED (every selected path), EXC (the paths the ADRs
# list under `exceptions`) and, in LEAK_WORK, the path:line of every line the range adds.
