# subjects: one per module.yaml added or changed.
#   files        that module.yaml
#   fingerprint  what the judge compares it with: the concern, home and api of every OTHER module
#                (a change to another module judges this one again), and the files (and their
#                content) the module's own home globs match (a file landing in its home does too).
# A change to one module leaves a module whose files and surroundings did not change as it was.
# Nothing here goes on without what it looked up: a path list, a module or a home listing that
# cannot be worked out refuses (a subject silently left out is a module nobody judges). The
# values that grow with the repo (the modules, the files a home matches) go to jq by file, never
# as one command-line argument (Linux caps one at 128 KB).
