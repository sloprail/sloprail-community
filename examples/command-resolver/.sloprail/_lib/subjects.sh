# Helpers for a rule's `subjects:` script. Source after changeset.sh (and the other libs it needs).
#
# `subjects:` splits a rule's changeset into units, each judged and stored on its own key. The
# key of a subject is its files' content plus its `fingerprint`, and nothing else, so:
#
#   - `files` are changed files the rule SELECTED (the engine refuses any other): the part of the
#     change that is this unit's;
#   - `fingerprint` must cover EVERYTHING ELSE the unit's verdict reads: a file the check opens
#     from $SR_TREE that did not change, a base-side content, a list of siblings. A dependency
#     left out is a stale verdict served after it changes: worse than no split.
#
# The script runs in `run` and in `verify` alike, with no session, from the head tree.
# The rule's own checks then read `.subject.id` (subject_id / want_subject in changeset.sh) and
# judge that unit alone: the payload they get is still the whole changeset.
#
#   payload="$(cat)"; . changeset.sh; . subjects.sh
#   sub_finish FALLBACK_ID "$(jq ... one array of {id, files, deps, bdeps, extra})"

SUBJECTS="[]"

# These scripts run in `verify` (Stop, pre-push, CI) as well as `run`, so they are written for
# speed: work from the changeset payload, never walk history, and spawn a fixed number of
# processes whatever the number of units (one jq over the whole payload, one `git cat-file
# --batch-check` for every object id, one `git hash-object` for every fingerprint).
#
# A script builds ONE JSON array of {id, files, deps, bdeps, extra} and hands it to sub_finish:
#   deps   paths whose content at the range's head the verdict depends on (a file or a directory)
#   bdeps  paths whose content at the range's base it depends on
#   extra  any other text the verdict depends on
# The fingerprint is a hash of the extra text and each dep's object id.

# sub_oids REV — stdin: one path per line; stdout: the object id of each at REV ("-" if absent).
