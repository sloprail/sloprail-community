# Every piece of code belongs to exactly one module

## Concern

Which module owns each non-test Go file, so every concern has one home and no
code sits outside a boundary.

## Decision

- Every non-test Go file matching `space` lies in the `home` of exactly one
  module (a `module.yaml`).
- Module homes do not overlap.
- Each module states its concern in the `concern:` line of its `module.yaml`.
  No two modules' `concern:` lines name the same responsibility, whether
  under different words or with one split across two modules.
- A module's `home` holds only code of its `concern:`. A file belongs to
  another concern when its main responsibility is what another module's
  `concern:` line names.
- Other modules import a module only through the packages its `api:` lists.
