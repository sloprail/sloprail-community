# Shared by every rule in this example — sourced, never run. One reading of a
# scanner file and one reading of the registry, so the rules cannot disagree:
#
#   - scanner-declared (enter.sh) logs the keywords scanner_keywords reads;
#   - scanner-keywords-hold (drops-keywords.sh, record-admitted.sh) decides and
#     records a drop from the SAME reading. Two parsers used to disagree and fail
#     open: the guard's stopped at a column-0 comment the registry read past, so
#     a keyword after one could be dropped with no citation; and only the
#     registry stripped quotes, so re-quoting a keyword read as dropping it.
#   - search-needs-declared-scanner and verify-scanner-coverage read the
#     scanners still owed a search through registry_owed.
#
# A caller that cannot source this file cannot decide anything, and fails
# closed its own way (see each caller).
#
# The registry, per scanner folder <dir> (e.g. scanners/mine):
#   scanner-declared      scanner:<dir>   the keywords owed (JSON array); only
#                                         ever grows from what a write declares
#                         stamp:<dir>     a token renewed at every declaration
#   scanner-keywords-hold retired:<dir>   the stamp an admitted delete retired
#                         narrowed:<dir>  {stamp, keywords}: an admitted drop
# "Admitted" means the user's words were cited AND judged to ask for it. A
# retirement or a narrowing counts only while its stamp is the declaration's
# current one, so declaring the scanner again makes it owed in full again.

# scanner_keywords CONTENT — the keywords a scanner declares, one per line, in
# file order. `keywords` is a column-0 key (`keywords:` or `keywords :`) holding:
#   - a flow list on the key's line, which may run onto following lines until
#     its `]`: `keywords: [auth token, "leak", 'it''s']`;
#   - or a block list: `- value` items, at any indentation (column 0 is valid
#     YAML too). It ends at the next column-0 line that is neither an item nor a
#     comment — the next key. Comments and blank lines, at any column, do not
#     end it. An item's value is:
#       "double quoted" (the inside), 'single quoted' ('' is one quote),
#       a plain scalar — trailing ` # comment` dropped — continued by
#       more-indented lines that are not items (joined with one space),
#       or a block scalar `>`/`|` (its more-indented lines, joined with spaces).
# CRs are dropped. Anything else yields nothing — the registry then logs no
# keywords and the guard reads the rewrite as dropping every keyword, both the
# fail-closed direction.
