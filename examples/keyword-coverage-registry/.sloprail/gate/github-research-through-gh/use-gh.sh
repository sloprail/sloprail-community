# Decides whether this call is GitHub research outside gh — any WebSearch; a
# WebFetch whose URL's HOST is a GitHub content host (or a literal address in
# GitHub's published ranges); a curl/wget/httpie that fetches one, reads its
# URLs from a file, or runs on a line where a GitHub host can feed it (a
# variable, a substitution, an earlier pipeline stage) — and refuses it with the
# remedy: the same research through gh, against a declared scanner. Anything
# else permits.
#
# The host is parsed the way a browser parses a URL (see gate.yaml) rather than
# matched by a regex over the raw text, which `https:github.com`,
# `https:\\github.com`, `git%68ub.com` and `github.com.` each evaded.
