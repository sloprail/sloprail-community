# `when` for the user citation a scanner's keywords need: does this write DROP a
# keyword the scanner already declared? Exit 0 — it does, so the write must cite
# the user's words asking for it. Exit 1 — it does not (a new scanner, or one that
# only adds keywords), so no citation is required. Deleting the scanner drops
# every keyword it declared, so a delete of one that declared any applies too.
# A created scanner can drop keywords too: one declared this session and committed
# as a new file drops whatever the registry owes that the file no longer declares.
#
# This is the file-guard entry: it reads the Changeset, each scanner as it stood at
# the range's base against how it stands at head (a rename is the old scanner
# deleted and the new one created). The gate of the same name keeps the pre-write
# copy.
#
# THIS IS A `when` PREDICATE, NOT A CHECK: exit 0 does not permit anything — it
# APPLIES the requirement. So every path this script cannot decide exits 0, the
# fail-closed direction; only exit 1 waives the citation, and only on a decided
# "drops nothing".
#
# The failure it exists for, measured on a real Haiku run: refused by the
# coverage gate for a search that missed keywords, the agent rewrote the
# scanner's keywords to fit the search it had already run — the declaration
# weakened to match the work, instead of the work meeting the declaration.
