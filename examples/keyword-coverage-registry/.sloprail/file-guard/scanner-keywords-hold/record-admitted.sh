#!/usr/bin/env bash
# FILE-GUARD copy: reads the Changeset (each scanner as committed at head against the
# range's base). The gate of the same name keeps the pre-write copy.
# The LAST check: reached only once everything before it admitted the event —
# the citation requirement (when drops-keywords.sh applied it) and the judge.
# It records what the user asked for, so the registry stops owing it:
#
#   - a DELETE of the scanner retires it: `retired:<folder>` = the declaration's
#     current stamp. Without this, a scanner declared this session stayed owed
#     forever after the user had it removed, and every later Stop was refused.
#   - a write that DROPS keywords narrows it: `narrowed:<folder>` =
#     {stamp, keywords: what the scanner now declares}. The registry itself
#     only ever grows (scanner-declared's enter.sh); this is the one way a
#     keyword stops being owed.
#
# Only with a resolved citation of the user's own words on the changeset. That is
# what "the user asked for it" means here, and it is checked again rather than
# inferred from having been reached: drops-keywords.sh waives the citation for a
# change it decides drops nothing, and a scanner emptied by a write the engine
# could not parse used to reach this point uncited and be retired — the
# obligation gone with the user never asked.
#
# Both records count only while their stamp is the current declaration's
# (scanner-lib.sh), so declaring the scanner again makes it owed in full again,
# and a retirement also needs the file really gone. A delete no rule saw
# (`find … -delete`) never reaches this script and retires nothing.
#
# Nothing to record: permit. A record that cannot be written or read: refuse —
# the record is what makes an admitted change safe to let through, and one that
# silently failed would leave the next Stop refused over what the user asked for.
