# The plan-2026-09-24 shift: an eval no longer scores "did the guardrail catch
# the violation" as the primary signal — a model figuring out the right thing
# on its own, guardrail or not, is ALSO a fine outcome. What actually matters is
# whether the whole run's TRAJECTORY looks healthy: no stuck retry loops, no
# guardrail that never resolves, no wandering. Whether the guardrail fired is
# still recorded as a secondary, informational signal — useful for the
# analysis, not the pass/fail bar by itself.

# file_guard_judge_ran: did the named file-guard's judge reach a verdict on THIS
# run's change to <file>? A file-guard's verdicts live on the project's results
# branch (sloprail/checks, internal/checkcache), keyed by what was judged, and
# `sr-checks show` reads them without asking a model or writing anything. A judge
# that was skipped (its prepare script found nothing to judge, or a cheap check
# refused first) is reported `skipped`, and one never asked `missing`; neither is a
# judgement, so a run whose rule never judged anything cannot pass on that rule's
# behalf.
#
# Scoped to the run, not to any verdict anywhere:
#   - the range is the work the run did: from where work on HEAD started (the merge
#     base with the default branch, `sr-checks default-base`), else from the commit
#     sr-eval installed the rules in (SR_EVAL_RULES_COMMIT), up to the project's HEAD.
#     A verdict recorded for other content (the file changed after it was judged)
#     is a different key, so it is `missing` here and does not count;
#   - the rule's own changeset over that range holds <file> (`sr-checks changeset`):
#     the file was in the range the rule judged;
#   - the judge's check (kind `check[N]:judge:...`) came back pass or fail.
#
# `sr-checks` is found on PATH, with SR_EVAL_BIN_DIR prepended as for every scorer.
#
# Usage: file_guard_judge_ran '<name>' '<file>' ; # sets JUDGE_RAN, JUDGE_DETAIL
# JUDGE_RAN is yes only on a verdict found by the above; no when the run's range was
# read and holds none; unknown when it could not be looked at (no jq, no sr-checks,
# no git, no project, no commit). A scorer that needs the judgement fails on
# anything but yes.
