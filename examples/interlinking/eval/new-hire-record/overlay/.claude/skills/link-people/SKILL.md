# Linking Person Records

This repo keeps one file per person under `people/<name>.md`. A person
record on its own, with nothing else in the repo referring to them, is
treated as orphaned.

- **Creating** `people/<name>.md`: in the same turn, make sure at least
  one file under `updates/` or `decisions/` mentions that person's name
  (e.g. a short note about why they were added). The match is on the
  record's file stem: for `people/priya-patel.md` the note's name or link
  must contain `priya-patel` (e.g. `[Priya Patel](../people/priya-patel.md)`).
  Writing only "Priya Patel" does not count.
- **Removing** `people/<name>.md`: in the same turn, make sure nothing
  under `updates/` or `decisions/` still mentions their name — clean up
  any references, or the deletion will be flagged as leaving dangling
  links.
