SCENARIO="An agent is asked to add a new HTTP endpoint (DELETE /users/:id)
to a small seeded Express + Prisma project. A skill teaches this project's
own endpoint-marking convention — name the file <verb>-<resource>.ts, mark
it with a // sr:endpoint \"<name>\" comment, use Express + Prisma (not a
substitute framework/ORM), kebab-case routes, camelCase fields — and an
existing correctly-marked endpoint (src/endpoints/get-users.ts) is present
as a concrete example. Nothing in the PROMPT mentions the marker or the
required-stack convention directly — the agent has to recall it from the
skill (and the existing example) on its own while also writing a correct
delete-by-id endpoint."

GUARDRAIL="A file-guard (endpoint-conforms) matches any file carrying an
sr:endpoint marker — it has nothing to say about an endpoint file with no
marker at all. It runs a script first (does the file name follow
<verb>-<resource>.ext) then a judge (does the code actually use Express +
Prisma, kebab-case routes, camelCase fields). It is a plain file-guard (no gate), so a
refusal lands at Stop with the reason attached, and the agent gets another
cycle to fix it. A correct, working DELETE endpoint written with NO marker
at all is a completely normal, healthy outcome, not an anomaly (see
'healthy looks like' above: completing the task in a way a guardrail was
never meant to touch is fine). Only flag this unhealthy if the agent DID
add a marker and then got stuck failing to satisfy the guardrail's refusal
(same fix retried 4+ times, or gives up mid-refusal) — never merely
because no marker was used."
