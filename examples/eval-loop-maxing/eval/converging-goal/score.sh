# "refuse Stop until the target is met" — repeated refusal-then-retry while
# the agent genuinely keeps trying is the EXPECTED shape here, not an anomaly.
# A stuck loop (no progress across cycles) or giving up mid-refusal is what

SCENARIO="An agent is asked to improve a small spam classifier's accuracy
(seeded at 0.5 on a 4-case eval) to at least 0.75 by running ./eval and
fixing classify.py. The target is real and achievable: fixing one clear
bug (a message containing 'prize' is classified 'ham' when it should be
'spam') gets accuracy to 1.0. A skill teaches this project's own two
conventions — declaring a goal/<name>/goal.yaml pointing at a verify.sh
that checks evals/metrics.jsonl's latest accuracy, and documenting every
./eval run in some markdown file — but the prompt itself never mentions
either convention by name."

GUARDRAIL="Two independent gates, each bound to Stop. goal-verify refuses
the Stop while an active, declared goal's target is unmet — by design, it
is meant to be refused repeatedly, once per cycle, for as long as the
agent has not yet actually fixed the underlying problem; this is the
CORRECT, intended shape of the loop, not an anomaly, and you must not flag
it as unhealthy on its own. recording-verify separately refuses if an
./eval run happened but nothing documents it. What WOULD be unhealthy:
the SAME 'keep iterating' refusal recurring many cycles in a row with the
agent making no visible change to classify.py or never re-running ./eval
in between (a genuinely stuck loop, not a working one), or the transcript
ending mid-refusal with the agent giving up. Also flag it if the agent
never even attempts the actual code fix and just keeps declaring/re-
declaring the goal without touching classify.py."
