// A delete whose content the engine did not read (#84: `oldContentKnown: false`,
// e.g. `rm -r` past the engine's byte budget) carries an empty oldContent and no
// oldMarkers. Taken at face value, an empty oldContent makes a pinned spec's lines
// look unchanged by the delete, and no markers make a marked file look unmarked —
// both fail open. The predicate reads an empty oldContent from HEAD instead (the
// field itself is not in main's registry yet, so it is not read); the payloads
// here carry it as #84's engine will.
