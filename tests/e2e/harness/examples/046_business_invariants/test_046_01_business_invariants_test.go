// TODO(D3): drive verdict via a10n-claude-mock once a10n-cli#470 lands + new mock
// on PATH; today InstallJudgeClaude supplies the verdict.
//
// Use case: business-invariants (unit 04 + its 02_pinned-spec-reference addendum).
// pinned-invariant, a plain file-guard (it acts at Stop, on the settled file;
// pinned-spec-holds is the rule that ships a gate too), bound to a file carrying
// an `sr:invariant` marker whose fqn is a pinned spec reference `<repo>@<sha>:<path>#L<start>-<end>`. Two checks divide
// the work, cheap-gates-expensive:
//
//   - SCRIPT (pin-still-matches-head.sh): does the pin resolve (real commit, real
//     path, real line range) AND does the pinned range still match HEAD? Pure git
//     byte-comparison — catches spec drift with no model.
//   - JUDGE (code-upholds-invariant.md.j2): given the pinned text, does the marked
//     code actually enforce what it says?
//
// A file-guard acts only at Stop, so every refusal here arrives there and is read
// with BlockingErrorsFrom(proj, sess, "Stop"); res.Refused() (the PreToolUse deny
// marker) stays false for this rule.
//
// How each mechanism is driven:
//   - MARKER: written in the file's own content as a `// sr:invariant "<fqn>"`
//     line, so filemod.Scan lifts it onto the event's newMarkers and the guard's
//     `match: any(markers, .kind == "invariant")` selects the file.
//   - GIT: e.GitInit + real commits via e.Git; the spec file is committed at a
//     known sha, and the marker's fqn pins a line range at that sha. The stale
//     case commits a reworded spec so HEAD's line no longer matches the pin.
//   - JUDGE verdict: InstallJudgeClaude supplies the model's pass/fail.
//
// The example is installed VERBATIM — its scripts ship executable (mode 100755),
// so the rule's own logic runs as a user would get it (the script-refusal tests
// carry an exec-bit regression tripwire that names it precisely if that regresses).
