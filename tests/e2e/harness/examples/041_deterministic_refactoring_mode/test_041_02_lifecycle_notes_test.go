// This file covers the CONTEXT + STOP-GATE half of the deterministic-refactoring
// example — the "did every declared move actually land" completeness check. In
// the new nature format a context's exit is PURE LIFECYCLE and cannot block a
// Stop (only a gate blocks), so the completeness refusal lives in the paired Stop
// gate `gate/refactor-complete`, not in the context's exit. These tests prove the
// gate blocks an incomplete refactor (T041_07) and permits a completed one
// (T041_08), and pin the context-activation behavior the gates rest on
// (T041_06). None of this disturbs the reconcile gate (T041_01..05).

// T041_06: the `refactoring` context activates on ANY PreToolUse, not only when a
// `#refactor` was declared — so the reconcile gate fires on a moved-from marker even
// with NO refactor declaration.
//
// enter.sh means to DECLINE (not activate) when it finds no #refactor, and does so
// with `exit 0` and no stdout. But the engine's enter semantics read "clean exit,
// empty stdout" as "ACTIVATE, keeping the prior payload" (dispatch/context.go) —
// the way to decline is a NON-ZERO exit or an unmet `require`. So enter.sh's
// exit-0 decline is a no-op: the context activates on every PreToolUse. The
// practical effect is benign for the reconcile gate (its match ALSO requires an
// sr:moved-from marker, which is the real narrowing — see T041_04), and benign for
// the completeness gate (with no #refactor declared, declared_markers is empty and
// the gate permits — proven here: this run carries no Stop completeness block).
//
// This test asserts the CURRENT behavior: a moved-from write with NO #refactor
// prose is STILL guarded (refused when it does not reconcile), and no completeness
// block fires (nothing was declared).

// T041_07: a DECLARED refactor whose moves were NEVER WRITTEN is BLOCKED at Stop
// by the completeness gate.
//
// This is the fix's core assertion. The blocking is done by the Stop GATE
// `gate/refactor-complete`, NOT by the context's exit (a context's exit is pure
// lifecycle and cannot refuse a Stop — services/sr-session/nature_context.go).
// The gate reads the refactoring context's `declared_markers` (populated by the
// context's enter at the PostTagWrite trigger, which fires at Stop once the turn
// is settled in the transcript) and refuses when a declared move never landed as
// an `sr:moved-from` marker.
//
// The declared scope names the fqn a completed move WOULD carry
// (`origin.go@<sha>:1-3`); the turn writes an unrelated file carrying no such
// marker, so the move is outstanding and the turn cannot end.
//
// (This test previously PINNED the broken state — it asserted NO Stop block,
// because three bugs made the old context-exit completeness check dead: (1) enter
// read the #refactor tag off `.tags` instead of `.fields.tags`, so the scope was
// never captured; (2) the exit greped `sr:$marker` where $marker already began
// `sr:`, a double prefix; (3) the declared token was a logical nickname with no
// correspondence to the landed-marker syntax. All three are fixed: the tag field
// is read correctly AND the enter now also runs at the PostTagWrite trigger so the
// scope is visible; the gate greps for the literal marker with no double prefix;
// and the declaration names the actual fqn, so a declared token IS a landed
// marker's fqn. The test is flipped to assert the block those fixes produce.)
