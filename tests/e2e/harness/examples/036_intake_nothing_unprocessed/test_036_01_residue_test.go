// This file drives the intake-nothing-unprocessed gate end to end against the
// SHIPPED example. The gate fires on Stop and refuses when a user message this
// session is neither mapped to a task under tasks/ nor explicitly skipped.
//
// # What the mock can and cannot present
//
// The gate counts user messages via `sr-session trajectory normalize | jq
// 'select(.type=="user")'`. Every scenario here drives a single `Say` turn, which is a
// pure-text assistant record with NO tool call — so the mock synthesises no
// tool_result, and the only `type:"user"` entry the transcript carries is the seeded
// root (the prompt). (A tool turn WOULD add a tool_result `type:"user"` entry — since
// the mock now stamps a uuid on it, transcript reading keeps it — so these scenarios
// deliberately avoid one, keeping exactly one accountable user message.) That one
// message is enough to exercise all three logic branches (unaccounted → refuse;
// accounted via a task → admit; not-fired-outside-Stop), which is what these tests do.
// A residue of SEVERAL distinct user messages cannot be presented through this mock,
// and is noted as a harness limitation rather than faked.
//
// The root prompt does NOT sit on physical line 1: the mock opens every fresh
// transcript with its no-uuid preamble block (custom-title / mode / last-prompt) ahead
// of the root, so the message's ref line is the harness's RootMessageLine, not 1.

// residueReason is the gate's own refusal wording (verify-no-residue.sh) — the
// words that must reach the agent when a message is unaccounted for.

// REFUSED at Stop, and the gate's own reason reaches the agent.

// became neither a task nor an explicit skip) must not pass silently.
