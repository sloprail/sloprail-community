// This package is the end-to-end for the intake-nothing-unprocessed USE CASE
// (strategy unit 15): a gate bound to Stop that refuses when a user message this
// session is neither mapped to a task under tasks/ nor explicitly skipped. The
// whole thing runs through a10n-claude-mock against the SHIPPED example lifted
// verbatim off disk, so what fires is the plugin's own dispatch reaching the
// shipped gate.yaml + its check.
//
// Two accounting paths, both now delivered by the fixed example:
//   - a TASK: the gate greps tasks/ (anchored on $SR_WORKSPACE — a check's cwd is
//     the guardrail folder, not the repo root) for a reference to the message.
//   - a SKIP: the agent declares `#skip <line>` in prose; the sibling
//     skip-declared context enters on that tag (inside a hook, where `state set`
//     is in scope), logs skip:<transcript>:<line>-<line> to its own registry, and
//     the gate reads it with `state list --owner skip-declared`. The redesign is
//     what makes the skip work at all — the agent cannot run `state set` from its
//     own shell (no SR_GUARDRAIL), so the write had to move behind a context.
//
// The gate stays on EVERY Stop and does NOT require the skip context (it must
// check the residue whether or not a skip was declared); the Stop dispatch order
// (context enters before Stop gates) keeps a this-cycle #skip visible to it.
//
// # Harness note
//
// The mock yields exactly ONE normalized type:"user" entry per session (the
// prompt); its tool_result records carry no uuid and are dropped by transcript
// reading. So each scenario has one accountable user message (line 1), which is
// enough to exercise refuse / task-admit / skip-admit / wrong-line-skip. A residue
// of several distinct user messages cannot be presented through this mock.

// installExampleTree copies the WHOLE shipped `examples/<name>/.sloprail` tree
// into the project verbatim, recursively, so the test exercises the file a user
// would lift rather than a copy restated in the test.
//
// Read off disk, not restated: a test holding its own copy of the gate.yaml and
// its check would prove that copy works and say nothing about the shipped file,
// and the two would drift the first time either was edited alone. This is the
// "lift the real shipped file" install the task calls for.
//
// The copy is VERBATIM, mode included — every shipped example script now carries
// the execute bit in git (100755), so preserving fi.Mode().Perm() lands a
// runnable hook without the copy having to force it. (An earlier revision
// force-chmod'd .sh to 0755 to paper over some scripts that shipped 0644; that
// packaging inconsistency has since been fixed at the source, so the deviation
// is gone and the install is a plain verbatim copy.)
