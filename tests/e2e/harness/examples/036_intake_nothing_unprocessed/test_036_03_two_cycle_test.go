// T036_06: a skip DECLARED IN A LATER CYCLE still excuses an EARLIER cycle's
// message — the skip-declared context's registry (sr-session state) persists
// across Stop cycles even though the context's OWN active flag does not
// (exit.sh unconditionally deactivates every Stop: "the skips live in state
// that persists across cycles on its own").
//
// Every existing test in this suite drives exactly one Stop cycle. T036_01
// proves an unaccounted message is refused WITHIN that cycle; T036_04 proves a
// #skip declared in the SAME cycle as the message excuses it. Neither proves
// the doc comment's actual cross-cycle claim: that the skip REGISTRY, not the
// context's active flag, is what survives — because verify-no-residue.sh reads
// `state list --owner skip-declared` fresh every Stop, independent of whether
// skip-declared happens to be active THIS cycle.
//
// Cycle 1: the one user message (the root prompt) is left unaccounted —
// refused, same as T036_01. Cycle 2: the agent declares #skip naming that
// FIRST message's line (not a new message) — no task, no new unaccounted
// message, just the retroactive skip. The residue must empty and the Stop
// must admit, proving the skip resolves an ALREADY-OPEN violation from an
// earlier cycle, not merely one declared inline with the message itself.
