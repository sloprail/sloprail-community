// This file drives the SHIPPED eval-loop-maxing example end to end — the whole
// .sloprail tree installed verbatim, exactly what a user lifts. The engine
// mechanics of the goal-tracking + goal-verify composite are already pinned by
// tests/e2e/harness/context/035_context_dispatch (T035_07) with INLINE guardrails; what
// these tests add is that the SHIPPED scripts (context/goal-tracking/enter.sh,
// gate/goal-verify/run-verify.sh, exit.sh) actually drive the loop:
//
//   - a goal-tracking CONTEXT enters on a settled PostFileWrite of
//     goal/<name>/goal.yaml, activates for an enabled goal, and carries the
//     goal's name in its payload;
//   - a goal-verify GATE bound to Stop, require:[{context: goal-tracking}], reads
//     that payload and runs the goal's own verify.sh — BLOCKING the Stop with
//     "keep iterating until verify.sh passes" while the target is unmet;
//   - the context's exit reads the gate's verdict from `gates` and deactivates
//     once the gate passed.
//
// The goal itself is NOT installed from the example: README is explicit that
// goal/<name>/{goal.yaml,verify.sh} is a project-level sibling of .sloprail/,
// authored BY THE AGENT mid-trajectory (before that write the folder does not
// exist). So the tests write goal.yaml through a real agent turn and lay down a
// verify.sh whose verdict the test controls by flipping a single file.

const goalName = "accuracy-target"

// goalYAML is what an agent writes the moment it commits to a target: enabled,
// pointing at verify.sh as the goal's condition. Exactly the shape the shipped
// enter.sh reads (`^enabled:` must be true) and run-verify.sh resolves
// (`^script:` names the script it runs).
const goalYAML = "enabled: true\nscript: verify.sh\n"

// goalVerify is the goal's fixed condition, laid into goal/<name>/verify.sh as an
// executable. It passes only once the target-met marker exists in the workspace —
// the deterministic stand-in for "the measured metric now meets the threshold",
// flipped by the agent writing that marker. It reads $SR_WORKSPACE the same way
// the shipped verify.sh does, so it resolves the marker from the project root
// regardless of the check's cwd.
const goalVerify = `#!/bin/sh
if [ -f "${SR_WORKSPACE:-.}/target-met" ]; then
  exit 0

// keepIterating is the sentence the SHIPPED run-verify.sh refuses a premature
// Stop with. Matched on rather than on the word "block", so the test cannot pass
// on a refusal that came from anywhere else in the engine.
const keepIterating = "keep iterating until verify.sh passes"

// T050_01: the shipped example drives the loop — an unmet goal BLOCKS the Stop
// and RE-FIRES on the next Stop still unmet, then a met goal ADMITS.
//
// One session, three cycles, because the loop is a property of the session's
// accumulated state:
//
//   - Cycle 1 (violation): the agent authors goal/accuracy-target/goal.yaml
//     (enabled) with the marker absent. The context enters and activates carrying
//     the goal; the goal-verify gate reads it, runs verify.sh, it fails, and the
//     Stop is blocked with "keep iterating". GateState is fail.
//   - Cycle 2 (re-fire): the agent does more work but STILL does not meet the
//     target. The same gate wakes on this Stop, its require is still met (context
//     still active), verify.sh still fails, and the Stop is blocked AGAIN — proof
//     the gate re-fires rather than blocking only the first time. GateState is
//     still fail.
//   - Cycle 3 (fix): the agent writes the target-met marker. verify.sh now
//     passes, the gate admits the Stop, GateState flips to pass, and the context's
//     exit reads that pass and deactivates.

// (T050_01) and not otherwise is exactly what distinguishes the loop from a gate
// that blocks unconditionally.

// goal-free Stop and never run the check. Adding the same match-skip the sibling
// keyword-coverage-registry gate already uses realizes run-verify.sh's own
