// This file drives the SHIPPED required-context-precondition example end to end —
// BOTH gates installed verbatim, exactly what a user lifts. The gate ENGINE
// mechanic (a pure-require skill gate that blocks a PreFileWrite until the skill
// was loaded, and admits once it was) is already pinned by
// tests/e2e/harness/gate/032_gate_dispatch (T032_03/T032_04) with an INLINE gate; what
// these tests add is that the two SHIPPED gate.yaml files, as configured, each
// guard their own prefix with their own skill, independently:
//
//   - gate/require-skill-topics:    write under memories/topics/    ⇒ requires document-topic
//   - gate/require-skill-decisions: write under memories/decisions/ ⇒ requires document-strategy
//
// Both bind PreFileWrite, so they block BEFORE the write lands (a Post event would
// be too late). The refusal is a PreToolUse deny — Result.Refused reads it — and
// it must NAME the skill the prefix demands so the agent has something to act on.
