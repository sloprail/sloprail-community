// ENVELOPE WIRING for no-unasked-deletion: the whole answer ENVELOPE — the
// QUESTION and every answer — reaches the judge's prompt when the ask was an
// AskUserQuestion answer, not just the extracted answer.
//
// A removal citing an answer carries, as that citation's message, the whole
// envelope — the question with every answer given — and the judge template
// renders it. A judge grounded on an answer-quote needs the QUESTION to weigh the
// answer: an answer of "the second option" authorizes only what that option, in
// the question's own terms, covers. This captures the rendered prompt and asserts
// the QUESTION TEXT is in it.
//
// # Why TWO runs under one session
//
// An AskUserQuestion answer lands as a `user` record carrying a tool_result
// (harness.AnswerQuestion) — not a tool call, so it does not re-prompt the agent
// and cannot be a non-final turn that advances to a following Write in the same
// scenario. So the answer is emitted in its OWN Run, which leaves it in the
// session transcript; a SECOND Run under the SAME session id then makes the
// cited removal, whose quote resolves to the answer envelope from the first run. This is
// the harness's documented "Run more than once under the same conversation"
// (scenario.go), and it is how the answer and the guarded write share a trajectory.

// T049_15: the QUESTION the user answered reaches the judge's prompt via the
// envelope. Run 1 records the AskUserQuestion answer; Run 2's removal is grounded
// in it, so the citation carries the whole envelope and the template renders it —
// the judge sees what was ASKED, not only the answer quote.
