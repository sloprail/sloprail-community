// TODO(D3): drive verdict via a10n-claude-mock once a10n-cli#470 lands + new mock
// on PATH; today InstallJudgeClaude supplies the verdict.
//
// Use case: no-unasked-deletion (unit 17). A GATE on `event.path startsWith
// "memories/" and event.path endsWith ".md"` (PreFileWrite and PreFileDelete,
// refusing BEFORE the write lands — the content that would be lost is still on
// disk at Pre time), with a plain file-guard of the same name as the Stop
// after-check. "Asked" is a CITATION of the user's
// words on the command that makes the change (`sr-file ... --cite:user '<quote>'`),
// never a marker in the file.
//
// One conditional REQUIREMENT + one JUDGE:
//   - REQUIRE a user citation `when: ./removes-content.sh`: pure additions need
//     none; a removal (or a delete) citing nothing the user said is refused by the
//     engine; an unknown result (a quote that does not resolve, so sr-file's dry
//     run fails, or sr-file mixed into a longer line) fails closed.
//   - JUDGE (change-is-clean-and-absolute.md.j2), reached for a cited removal only
//     (its prepare skips a pure addition): the change is clean & targeted (only
//     what the cited words asked) and absolute (states the final content, not a
//     delta narrative).
//
// Because the rule is a GATE, refusals arrive at PRE-TOOL as a deny — read
// with res.Refused() and res.Saw(reason), NOT at Stop. A cited ADMIT lets the
// change land.
//
// How each mechanism is driven:
//   - CITATION: an `sr-file write|delete ... --cite:user '<quote>'` Bash turn run on
//     its own, so the engine dry-runs it for the exact result and resolves the
//     quote against the transcript (the user's prompt, seeded by the harness).
//   - UNCITED: a plain Write turn, or an `rm` Bash turn — neither can carry one.
//   - JUDGE verdict: InstallJudgeClaude supplies the model's pass/fail.
