// Deleting a declared scanner drops every keyword it declared. Found on a real
// security-scan run: refused at SubagentStop by verify-scanner-coverage, a
// sub-agent ran `rm -rf .../scanners/token-leakage-logs` — and the gate went
// quiet, because the context it matches on had closed at the refused Stop and no
// Post event re-entered it for a file that was gone.
//
// So: scanner-keywords-hold (deletions: include) refuses the delete itself —
// `rm -rf` of the scanner's directory included — without the user's words; and
// whatever still gets the file deleted does not clear the obligation: the
// context stays open while coverage is refused, and the gate refuses from its
// registry whether or not the file survives.
