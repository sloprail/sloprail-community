// The file-guard's DEFINING property on the commit-based model: a not-fine change is
// judged over the RANGE of commits (merge-base..HEAD). So a not-fine
// endpoint keeps blocking the turn at Stop — even after an unrelated commit, which
// joins the range instead of moving its base — until a commit fixes it; from then
// on the passed range is behind and an unrelated commit is not held to it. The
// shipped marker-anchored example is a script plus a judge, so this installs a
// file-guard of the SAME shape (match: any(markers, .kind == "endpoint"), a
// deterministic script): the property is measured without any judge stub.

// T048_06: a not-fine endpoint file keeps blocking until fixed, then stops.
//
//   - Cycle 1 commits a FORBIDDEN endpoint; the guard refuses.
//   - Cycle 2 commits UNRELATED work (a clean, different endpoint) and does NOT touch
//     the bad file — yet the Stop is refused again: the bad file is still in the range.
//   - Cycle 3 FIXES the bad file; nothing new is refused.
//   - Cycle 4 does more unrelated work; the passed range is behind, so nothing is
//     refused on its account.
//
// Several cycles in one session are several Run calls with the same session id.
