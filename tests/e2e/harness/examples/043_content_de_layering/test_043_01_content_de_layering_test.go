// TODO(D3): drive the verdict via a10n-claude-mock once a10n-cli#470's mock grows
// sr-agent's claude-flag surface for this path; today the proven InstallJudgeClaude
// stub supplies the model verdict (the same substitution T034_09/10 make).
//
// content-de-layering is a file-guard over files under updates/ or branding/. Its
// one check is a judge (no prepare, no script tier). The judge renders the settled
// file's own content and rules on whether it restates a fact that lives elsewhere.
//
// The scenarios prove: a duplicated-fact file BLOCKS at Stop and the judge's
// reasoning reaches the agent (violation); a clean referencing file ADMITS (happy);
// a file OUTSIDE updates//branding/ is never judged, even holding the same content
// (does-not-fire control, incl. the near-miss the match deliberately excludes);
// the settled file's content and path reach the rendered template (the
// event -> template wiring, this example's stand-in for prepare -> template since
// it has no prepare); and — the file-guard property — a not-fine file RE-FIRES
// each cycle until it is FIXED.

// duplicatedUpdate is an update file that spells out a person's standing detail
// inline instead of linking to their file — the exact "one fact, two homes"
// failure this rule catches. The fact string is distinctive so a test can find it
// in the rendered prompt.

//     can ONLY come from re-judging the still-outstanding bad file — so R2
//     appearing proves the re-fire re-judged a file this cycle never touched.
//   - Cycle 3 FIXES the bad file (rewrites it to a clean reference); the judge is
//     set to pass, and the file clears.
//   - Cycle 4 again does work outside the match, with the judge set to refuse with
